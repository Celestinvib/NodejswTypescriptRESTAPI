Installation:
npm install --save-dev@types/node --> Allow ts to use node code
npm install --save-dev@types/express
npm install --save-dev@types/body-parser

Programming Details:
*Check the tsconfig.json to check the compile options of ts 
*npm start -> to run the server (after compile ts to js 'tsc[command]') 
before moving the js files to dist it was node app.js (now runing thanks to the script start set in package.json)
